"""CARNIVAL network inference with CORNETO.

This script uses the CARNIVAL algorithm (implemented in CORNETO) to find
an optimal subnetwork of the prior knowledge network that connects
perturbations to measurements.

In our "early" model (corresponding to model 2 in the paper):
- Perturbations (inputs): TGFB1 stimulus + early TF/kinase activities
- Measurements (outputs): early secretome fold changes

CARNIVAL solves an integer linear program that:
- Maximizes consistency between network edges and observed data
- Minimizes network size (L0 penalty on active edges)

# %% 4. Build CARNIVAL optimization problem
#
# CARNIVAL finds the smallest subnetwork of the PKN that is logically
# consistent with the observed perturbation and measurement data.
# The optimization has two objectives:
#
#   Objective 0 (data fit): how well do the network edge signs agree
#       with the observed activity scores? Each measurement node has
#       an observed sign (+/-); the network should propagate signals
#       from perturbations to measurements without contradictions.
#       Lower = better fit (fewer sign mismatches).
#
#   Objective 1 (network size): how many edges are active? This is the
#       L0 regularization term — "L0" simply means we count the number
#       of non-zero (active) edges. We want a parsimonious network:
#       the simplest explanation consistent with the data.
#
# lambda_reg controls the trade-off between these two objectives:
# - Higher lambda_reg -> sparser network (fewer edges, possibly worse fit)
# - Lower lambda_reg -> denser network (better fit, harder to interpret)
#
# CarnivalFlow is a specific CARNIVAL formulation that models signal
# propagation as network flow, which makes the optimization more
# efficient for large networks.

# %% 5. Solve
#
# The problem is a Mixed Integer Program (MIP): some variables are
# continuous (flow values), others are binary (is this edge active?).
# MIP problems are NP-hard in general, but modern solvers handle
# networks of this size well.
#
# We use SCIP, a powerful open-source MIP solver. CVXPY translates
# our problem into SCIP's format and calls it. Other options:
# - "highs": another open-source solver, sometimes faster
# - "scipy": simpler, works for small problems
#
# The solver output is verbose but informative. Here's a quick guide
# to what you'll see:
#
# 1. CVXPY compilation: CVXPY converts the problem into standard form.
#    "Your problem has N variables, M constraints" tells you the size.
#
# 2. Presolving: SCIP simplifies the problem before solving — removing
#    redundant variables and constraints, tightening bounds. Lines like
#    "959 del vars, 158226 del conss" mean it eliminated that many.
#    This can take 30-60s but dramatically speeds up the actual solve.
#
# 3. Solving: The main table shows progress. Key columns:
#    - time: elapsed seconds
#    - node/left: search tree progress (branch-and-bound exploration)
#    - dualbound: best possible objective (lower bound)
#    - primalbound: best feasible solution found so far (upper bound)
#    - gap: relative difference between the two bounds; 0% = optimal
#
#    Lines starting with "o" or "d" mark new best solutions found.
#    The solver is done when gap reaches 0% or the time limit is hit.

# %% Notes
#
# If the network is too sparse, try:
#   - Decreasing lambda_reg (e.g., 0.001)
#   - Increasing the time limit
#   - Using a different solver (e.g., "scip" for better MIP performance)
#
# If the network is too dense, try:
#   - Increasing lambda_reg (e.g., 0.1)
#   - Applying stricter significance thresholds for inputs/outputs
#
# The next script (04) will visualize the resulting network.
