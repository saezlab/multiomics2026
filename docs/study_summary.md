Kidney fibrosis is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease, driven by the
excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) by myofibroblast-like cells.
TGF-beta signaling is a key driver of this fibrotic transformation, yet the
full cascade of molecular events downstream of TGF-beta — spanning from
minutes to days — remains incompletely understood. This study addresses this
gap by generating a comprehensive time-resolved multi-omics dataset using an
_in vitro_ model of TGF-beta-induced fibrotic transformation. The model uses
PDGFR-beta positive patient-derived kidney mesenchymal cells, which closely
resemble the myofibroblasts implicated in kidney fibrosis _in vivo_ (Kuppe
*et al.*, 2021).

The experiment stimulates these cells with 10 ng/ml TGF-beta and profiles
molecular changes at 7 time points (5 min, 1 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h,
and 96 h) across 4 omics modalities: transcriptomics (~14,800 genes),
proteomics (~7,000 proteins), phosphoproteomics (~17,200 phosphosites), and
secretomics (~2,200 secreted proteins). This is complemented by
immunofluorescence imaging of collagen I deposition, providing a phenotypic
readout of ECM accumulation. In total, the dataset quantifies over 14,000
biomolecules, making it one of the most comprehensive time-resolved multi-omics
studies of fibrotic signaling.

A central finding is that the cellular response to TGF-beta unfolds in
distinct temporal phases. Early responses (within minutes to hours) are
dominated by phosphorylation signaling — particularly the canonical SMAD2/3
pathway — and rapid transcriptional activation of immediate-early genes. By
12–24 h, a transition occurs toward sustained transcriptomic and proteomic
reprogramming, with upregulation of ECM components, collagens, and
matrix-modifying enzymes. Late responses (48–96 h) involve the actual
secretion and deposition of ECM fibers, which depends not only on collagen I
itself, but on a network of cross-linking, assembly, and degradation factors.

To connect the early signaling events to the late phenotypic outcomes, the
study employs mechanistic network modeling using CORNETO (Rodriguez-Mier
*et al.*, 2025) with the CARNIVAL algorithm (Liu *et al.*, 2019). Molecular
activities of transcription factors and kinases are first inferred from
transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics data using Decoupler (Badia-i-Mompel
*et al.*, 2022). These activities, together with secretome fold changes, are
then mapped onto a prior knowledge network of signed, directed
protein–protein interactions from OmniPath (Türei *et al.*, 2026). The
optimization finds subnetworks that most parsimoniously explain the observed
activity patterns given TGF-beta as the known perturbation. Multiple network
inference steps are performed to capture the temporal dynamics: an initial
network with only TGF-beta as input, an early response network incorporating
early secretome hits, an early-to-late transition network, and a late response
network.

The study validates its findings in several ways: by comparing to kidney
fibrosis patient transcriptomics data, by testing the model in lung
fibroblasts and precision-cut tissue slices, and by siRNA knockdown of key
transcription factors identified by the network analysis. This knockdown
experiment confirms that the predicted transcription factors indeed regulate
collagen I deposition, providing functional validation of the computational
network inference approach.
